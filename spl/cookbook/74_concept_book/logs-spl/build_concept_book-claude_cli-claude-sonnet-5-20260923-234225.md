## Gastrointestinal Tract

You already know food goes in one end and waste comes out the other — but the GI tract is really a 9-meter-long processing line, and each station does one job well.

Start in the mouth: chewing breaks food into pieces, and an enzyme called amylase starts splitting starch into sugars. Swallowing sends food down the esophagus, a muscular tube that doesn't just drop food by gravity — it uses **peristalsis**, waves of muscle contraction, so you could technically swallow upside down. The stomach then churns food into a liquid mix called chyme, using acid (pH around 1.5–3.5) and the enzyme pepsin to begin breaking down proteins.

The real chemistry happens next, in the small intestine, which is where absorption is engineered for maximum surface area. Two accessory organs feed into it: the liver makes bile (which emulsifies fats, breaking big fat globules into tiny droplets so enzymes can reach them), and the pancreas secretes enzymes that finish digesting carbs, proteins, and fats, plus bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acid. The small intestine's inner wall is folded into villi and microvilli — finger-like projections that can boost absorptive surface area roughly 600-fold compared to a smooth tube of the same length. That's the structural trick: instead of making the tube longer, the body makes the surface *wrinklier*.

Finally, the large intestine reabsorbs water and hosts trillions of bacteria that ferment leftover fiber.

**Simple rule:** mouth and stomach *mechanically and chemically break down*; small intestine *absorbs*; large intestine *reclaims water*.

**Practice problem:** If bile doesn't chemically digest fat but only emulsifies it, explain why a person with liver disease (low bile production) might have trouble absorbing fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.

## Regional Blood Flow Distribution

Not every organ needs the same share of blood at every moment. When you sprint, your muscles scream for oxygen; when you digest a big meal, your gut takes priority. The heart doesn't just pump harder overall — it *redistributes* cardiac output, sending more blood to the tissues that need it right now and less to the ones that can wait.

Here's the structural trick: total cardiac output $Q$ stays roughly constrained by what the heart can produce, but it's divided among parallel circuits — muscle, gut, skin, kidneys, brain — each acting like a resistor in a parallel network. Since these circuits share the same driving pressure (mean arterial pressure, $P$), flow to each organ $i$ follows a local version of Ohm's law for fluids:

$$
Q_i = \frac{P}{R_i}
$$

where $R_i$ is that organ's *local* vascular resistance. The body doesn't change $P$ much organ-to-organ — instead, it changes $R_i$ by dilating or constricting the arterioles feeding each region. Widen the vessels (vasodilation) and $R_i$ drops, so $Q_i$ rises even though $P$ hasn't changed. Narrow them (vasoconstriction) and $Q_i$ falls.

The simple rule: **blood flow is redistributed by adjusting local resistance, not by changing total pressure.** During exercise, muscle $R_i$ can drop so much that muscle flow increases 15–20 fold, while gut and kidney resistance rises to compensate, keeping total $Q$ and $P$ manageable.

**Practice problem:** At rest, an organ receives $Q = 200\ \text{mL/min}$ when $P = 100\ \text{mmHg}$. During exercise, its resistance $R_i$ drops to one-fourth its resting value, but $P$ stays the same. What is the new flow $Q_i$?

## Liver Metabolic Role

You already know the liver "processes what you eat" — but the deeper story is that it's a **chemical distribution center** sitting between your gut and the rest of your body, deciding what gets used now, stored for later, or thrown out.

After digestion, blood from your intestines flows through the *hepatic portal vein* straight into the liver, carrying glucose, amino acids, and fats. The liver's first job is buffering: it doesn't let your blood sugar spike or crash. When glucose is abundant, liver cells convert it into a branched storage molecule called **glycogen**, via a process called glycogenesis. When blood sugar drops — say, between meals — the liver reverses the reaction (glycogenolysis), releasing glucose back into the blood. This is a feedback loop:

$$\text{glucose} \xrightleftharpoons[\text{glycogenolysis}]{\text{glycogenesis}} \text{glycogen}$$

The liver also manufactures **bile**, a fluid stored in the gallbladder that emulsifies fats in the small intestine — breaking large fat droplets into smaller ones so digestive enzymes can reach more surface area. Meanwhile, the liver's detox function runs largely through two enzyme phases: Phase I reactions (often oxidation) make toxins more reactive, and Phase II reactions attach a molecule to make them water-soluble enough to excrete in urine or bile.

**Simple rule to remember:** the liver keeps blood chemistry in a narrow, stable range — this stabilizing behavior is called *homeostasis*, and the liver is one of the body's most important homeostatic organs.

**Practice problem:** After a big pasta dinner, blood glucose rises sharply. Name the process the liver uses to lower it, and explain in one sentence why storing glucose as glycogen is better than just leaving excess glucose in the bloodstream.

## Smooth Muscle

You already know smooth muscle is the involuntary kind — it lines your gut and blood vessels, squeezing without you ever telling it to. Now let's look at *why* it can keep contracting rhythmically on its own, and how we can describe that rhythm precisely.

Unlike skeletal muscle, which needs a nerve signal for every twitch, smooth muscle cells are electrically connected to each other through gap junctions — tiny channels that let electrical signals pass directly from cell to cell. This means a wave of contraction can spread through a whole sheet of muscle, like a stadium wave passing through a crowd, without a central "starter" for each cell. Some smooth muscle cells even generate their own spontaneous electrical signals, called pacemaker potentials, which repeat at a regular interval.

Because this activity repeats regularly, we can describe it the way we describe any periodic process. If a wave of contraction moves through the intestine — called peristalsis — with a period $T$ (time between waves), then the frequency is $f = \dfrac{1}{T}$. If $T = 20$ seconds, the muscle contracts at $f = 0.05$ Hz, or 3 times per minute. This is the same math you'd use for a heartbeat or a pendulum — a real, measurable rhythm, not just a metaphor for "automatic."

**Simple rule:** rhythmic contraction rate (contractions/min) $= \dfrac{60}{T \text{ (seconds)}}$.

**Practice problem:** A section of intestine contracts once every 15 seconds. (a) Find the frequency in Hz. (b) Find the number of contractions per minute.

## Splanchnic Circulation

You already know your gut, liver, spleen, and pancreas need blood — but the scale is bigger than most people expect. At rest, these organs together claim about 25% of everything your heart pumps out. That's a quarter of your cardiac output, $Q$, routed to organs that aren't even doing heavy mechanical work at that moment. Where does it all go, and why so much?

The answer is structural. Splanchnic circulation isn't one pipe — it's a branching, then re-converging system. Blood arrives via three major arteries (celiac trunk, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric), feeds capillary beds in the stomach, intestines, pancreas, and spleen, then instead of returning straight to the heart, it funnels through the portal vein *into the liver* before finally rejoining systemic circulation. This is a rare case of two capillary beds in series — a "portal system" — meaning nutrient-rich, sometimes toxin-carrying blood gets filtered by liver cells before it reaches the rest of your body.

The flow itself isn't fixed. Splanchnic flow $Q_s$ shifts with demand:

$$Q_s = \frac{\Delta P}{R}$$

where $\Delta P$ is the pressure difference driving flow and $R$ is vascular resistance. After a meal, local vasodilation drops $R$, so $Q_s$ rises sharply — sometimes doubling — to support digestion and absorption. During intense exercise, the body reverses this: splanchnic vessels constrict (raising $R$), redirecting blood to skeletal muscle instead.

**Practice problem:** If resting cardiac output is 5 L/min and splanchnic flow is 25% of that, how many liters per minute flow through the splanchnic circulation? If digestion doubles that flow, what's the new value?

## Sympathetic Parasympathetic Balance

Your body runs two automatic control systems that pull in opposite directions, and neither one is ever fully "off." The sympathetic nervous system readies you for action — pupils widen, heart rate climbs, blood shifts toward muscles. The parasympathetic system does the reverse — it slows the heart, lowers blood pressure, and redirects energy toward digestion and repair. Together they form a feedback pair, not a switch.

Think of each system as producing a signal strength, $S(t)$ for sympathetic drive and $P(t)$ for parasympathetic drive, both varying with time $t$. What actually controls an organ — say heart rate $H$ — isn't either signal alone, but their balance:

$$H(t) = H_0 + \alpha S(t) - \beta P(t)$$

Here $H_0$ is your resting baseline, and $\alpha, \beta > 0$ are sensitivity constants describing how strongly each system pulls the heart rate up or down. This is a linear model, one of the simplest ways scientists describe two opposing inputs combining into a single output — you'll meet this same additive structure again in physics (net force) and engineering (control systems).

The key pattern: **balance, not elimination**. A healthy system doesn't shut sympathetic drive to zero at rest — it keeps both signals active and shifts their ratio. Chronic stress means $S(t)$ stays elevated even when it shouldn't, keeping $P(t)$ suppressed and $H(t)$ chronically high.

**Practice problem:** Suppose $H_0 = 60$ bpm, $\alpha = 0.5$, $\beta = 0.3$. During a stressful event, $S = 40$ and $P = 10$. During calm rest, $S = 10$ and $P = 40$. Compute $H(t)$ for each situation, and explain in one sentence why the difference makes physiological sense.

## Hepatic First Pass Processing

Picture a busy customs checkpoint right after the border: nothing entering the country's main roads gets through without inspection first. Your gut is the border, and the liver is that checkpoint. Blood leaving the intestines doesn't join general circulation directly — it flows through the portal vein straight into the liver, which processes it before anything reaches the heart and the rest of the body.

What happens at that checkpoint is a set of specific jobs. Glucose absorbed from a meal gets pulled out of the blood and stored as glycogen, a branched polymer of glucose molecules — think of it as the liver converting spare cash into a savings account it can withdraw from later when blood sugar drops. Fats absorbed from digestion get packaged into lipoproteins, transport particles that can travel safely through watery blood. And the liver continuously makes bile, a fluid stored in the gallbladder and released back into the intestine to help emulsify fats during the next meal.

This arrangement is why the "first-pass effect" matters in pharmacology too: anything absorbed from the gut — nutrients or drugs taken orally — meets the liver before it meets any other organ, and the liver can transform or filter a large fraction of it immediately.

**Rule of thumb:** gut → portal vein → liver → rest of the body. The liver is not just one stop among many — it is the mandatory first stop.

**Practice problem:** If a drug is 90% removed by the liver on its first pass, and you swallow a 100 mg tablet, how much of the active drug reaches general circulation? Explain, in one sentence, why doctors sometimes give the same drug by injection instead of by pill to avoid this loss.

## Peristalsis And Motility

You already know the basics: your gut moves food along without you thinking about it, using squeeze-and-release waves. Now let's look at the actual mechanics.

Peristalsis is a *traveling wave of muscle contraction*. The gut wall has two layers of smooth muscle running in different directions — one circular (wrapping around the tube), one longitudinal (running along its length). Just behind a bolus of food, circular muscle contracts while longitudinal muscle relaxes, widening the tube. Just ahead, the opposite happens. This contraction-relaxation pair moves forward together, pushing food along like a wave passing through a rope. A second pattern, called segmentation, mixes food by contracting and relaxing alternating sections without net forward movement — think of it as kneading rather than conveying.

The controller here is the enteric nervous system, sometimes called the "second brain," a mesh of neurons embedded in the gut wall that can generate these rhythms on its own. But it doesn't act alone: the autonomic nervous system tunes it. Parasympathetic input (via the vagus nerve) speeds up and strengthens motility — the "rest and digest" state. Sympathetic input, activated by stress, suppresses it — blood and attention get redirected elsewhere, which is why stress can cause a "knotted stomach" or disrupted digestion.

**Simple rule:** motility strength is roughly proportional to parasympathetic tone and inversely related to sympathetic (stress) activation.

**Practice problem:** A student is anxious before an exam and skips breakfast, feeling "sick to their stomach." Using what you just learned about the autonomic nervous system's effect on peristalsis, explain in 2–3 sentences why stress might produce that physical sensation.

## Postprandial Glucose Response

You already know the basic picture: eat a meal, blood sugar rises, then falls back down. But the shape of that curve — how high it peaks, how fast it climbs, how long it takes to return to baseline — depends on a chain of physical and biological factors you can actually reason about.

Start with the input: carbohydrates break down into glucose, which enters the bloodstream through the gut wall. The *rate* of that entry is the key variable. It's controlled by **gastric emptying** (how fast food leaves your stomach), the meal's composition (fiber, fat, and protein all slow absorption), and how quickly you ate. Think of glucose entering your blood as a function $G_{in}(t)$ — a pulse that's tall and narrow for a fast, sugary meal, or low and wide for a slow, balanced one.

Meanwhile, your body removes glucose from the blood — call that $G_{out}(t)$ — mainly through insulin-driven uptake into muscle and liver cells, and directly through muscle activity itself (exercise increases $G_{out}$ independent of insulin).

Your actual blood glucose level $B(t)$ changes based on the balance:
$$\frac{dB}{dt} = G_{in}(t) - G_{out}(t)$$

A **spike** happens when $G_{in}$ outpaces $G_{out}$ sharply and briefly. The peak height and the area under the curve above baseline (called the *glucose excursion*) are what researchers track — large, frequent excursions are linked to metabolic strain over time, because they force big, repeated insulin surges.

**Practice problem:** Two students eat 50g of carbs each. Student A drinks fruit juice; Student B eats an apple with peanut butter. Sketch two rough $B(t)$ curves on the same axes, and label which curve has the steeper $dB/dt$ right after eating, and why.
